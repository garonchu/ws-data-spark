Assuming not outliers are present, I will start with the following
MinMax linear transformation equation to get the score to scale of [-10,10]

(b-a)[(x-min_x)/(max_x -min_x)]+a 
where a= -10 and b= 10

However, depending on the skewness of the data, or present of any outliers,
we can also do additional non-linear transformation prior to the above scaling. 
For example, by applying transformation such as Log, square root, or Box-Cox (with
carefully chosen lambda) we can bring the data to more normal like form, as well
bring the outliers back closer to the majority of the data. Additional testing
will be needed for each individual set of scores/unique set of POI to reach the 
desirable visualization need.
